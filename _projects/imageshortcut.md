# Pin any photo to your home screen for instant one-tap access.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnodenhond/ImageShortcut/refs/heads/main/app/src/main/play/listings/en-US/graphics/icon/imageshortcutbigicon.png align="center")

Stop hunting through your gallery. This app lets you create home screen shortcuts to the exact images you use the most, so you can open them instantly with a single tap.

Unlike widgets, shortcuts can be grouped together into folders to save home screen space.

Perfect for:
* QR codes (Wi-Fi, contact, menu)
* Tickets & passes
* ID, membership, and loyalty cards
* Work reference images, diagrams, and notes
* Frequent screenshots (receipts, order numbers)
* Favorite photos you want at your fingertips

Why you’ll love it
* Instant access: Jump straight to the image—no scrolling, no searching.
* Stay organized: Keep important images front and center on your home screen.
* Works offline: Your shortcuts open files stored on your device.
* Lightweight and simple: Focused on one job and does it fast.

How it works
1. Open the app and pick any image from your gallery.
2. Add it as a shortcut to your home screen.
3. Tap the shortcut anytime to view the image immediately.

# Frequently Asked Questions

*If I close or delete the image after creating a shortcut, what happens?*

> A local copy of the image is kept so the shortcut always keeps working.

*If I delete the shortcut, what happens to the local copy of the image?*

> Unfortunately the launcher does not inform any app when shortcuts are deleted. Whenever Image Shortcut runs or the device starts, it checks which shortcuts have been removed and deletes the corresponding images.

*There is no advertising and no in-app purchase. Do you make any money on this?*

> No, only spending money. To contribute to reducing my losses please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/arnodenhond)
