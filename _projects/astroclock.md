# Frequently asked questions

*How does this clock measure time*

> It does not measure time in hours or minutes but rather in years, moons, or days. The clock hands turn in clockwise direction just like a normal clock. The only real difference is that unlike seconds and minutes, there is not a whole number of days in a moon or moons in year.

*Can I make my own graphics theme or skin?*

> Yes, instructions will be published soon. Artists get their name and a clickable link in the app.

*There is no advertising and no in-app purchase. Do you make any money on this?*

> No, only spending money. To contribute to reducing my losses please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/arnodenhond)
