<a name=startup>
<hr><center><h2>Start-up</h2></center>
The application can be started in three modes, selectable through these command line parameters
<br>
<center>

<table><tr><td><u>mode</u></td><td><u>parameter</u></td></tr>
<tr><td>Server mode</td><td><i>server</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Stand-alone mode</td><td><i>alone</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>Client mode</td><td><b>no parameter!</b></td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<a name=config>
<hr><center><h2>Configuration</h2></center>

The supplied settings will be stored in a settings file called <i>suncertified.properties</i> located in the applications current working directory.
<br>
Whenever the settings file cannot be loaded, the default values will be used and the application will try to continue normally.
<br>
To run the application with different settings, the application must be restarted.

<hr><center><h3>datafile</h3></center>
<table><tr><td>
When starting the application in stand-alone or server mode the filename of the datafile must be specified.
<br>
The default filename is <i>db-2x2.db</i> however this is only valid if the file is present in the current working directory.

<br>
To be able to access the file from anywhere, supply a fully qualified path name like <i>/home/arno/SCJD/db-2x2.db</i> or <i>c:\documents\arno\SCJD\db-2x2.db</i>.
<br>
If the file can not be loaded, the application will terminate with errorlevel 36
<br>
The supplied setting will be the same in server and stand-alone mode.
</td><td>
<center><img src=screenshots/DataConfig.jpg></center>
</td></tr></table>

<hr><center><h3>client accepting</h3></center>

<table><tr><td>
When starting the application in server mode the number of the port on which the server should accept cients must be specified.
<br>
The default port number is <i>3688</i> any port number can be chosen on which the application can open a server socket.
<br>
If the socket can not be opened, the appliction will terminate with errorlevel 88. Check the firewall settings.
<br>
The supplied setting will also be the default setting when configurating the port number on which the client should connct to the server. (below)
</td><td>
<center><img src=screenshots/PortConfig.jpg></center>
</td></tr></table>

<hr><center><h3>server address</h3></center>

<table><tr><td>
When starting the application in client mode the address and port number on which to connect to the server must be specified.
<br>
The default server address is <i>127.0.0.1</i> but this could also be any other ip address or hostname.
<br>
The default port number is the value which was last saved here or as the server's port number. (above)
<br>
If the server can not be reached, the application will terminate with errorlevel 88.
<br>
As the client connects to the server on the same port number as which the server connects to the client, this setting is shared betweent the two.
</td><td>
<center><img src=screenshots/ServerConfig.jpg></center>
</td></tr></table>

<a name=gui>
<hr><center><h2>User client</h2></center>
<table><tr><td colspan=2>
The application's user interface has been kept to a bare minimum to avoid any possible confusion about its functionality.
<br>
The search panel is at the top of the window.
<br>
The center is fully occupied by the table showing the search results.
<br>
The book panel is at the bottom of the window.
<br>
The user interface can be closed by the platform dependant window closing operation.
<br>
Various pop-ups can be shown if certain errors occur. Unless the error message clearly states how to solve the problem, the application should probably be restarted.
<br>
The <i>extractors</i> menu has <i>create</i> and <i>delete</i> options which have not yet been implemented!

</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<hr><center><h3>searching extractors</h3></center>
The search panel allows the user to search the data.
<br>
The name and/or location fields of the resulting records will match the name and location specified in the appropriate textfields.
<br>
The specified fields must match the fields in the database records exactly.
<br>
If either name or location was not specified, all records matching only the specified field will be the result.
<br>
If both fields are omitted, all records in the database will be displayed in the table below.
</td><td rowspan=3>
<center><img src=screenshots/gui.jpg></center>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>

<hr><center><h3>viewing results</h3></center>
The table shows the search results.
<br>
Each column represents a field in the database and can be resized or rearranged as desired.
<br>
If there are more results than can be displayed in a single window, a scrollbar will appear on the right-hand side of the table allowing the user to scroll through the data.
<br>
When the user clicks on a record it will become selected, allowing it to be booked.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<hr><center><h3>booking a extractor</h3></center>
The user may only book extractors which are not yet booked!
<br>
Enter no more than 8 digits in the textfield on the bookpanel to book a extractor.
<br>

In client/server mode it is possible that a extractor was booked by another client after the gui (of this client) was last updated.
<br>
Before booking a extractor, the application reloads the data and displays a popup if the extractor was already booked.
</td></tr></table>

<a name=server>
<hr><center><h2>Database server</h2></center>
<table><tr><td>
The serverframe shows which client have (dis)connected and which requests they have sent.
<br>
Any errors generated by clients are also displayed here.
<br>
The thread that generated the log message can be identified by the address of the client handled by that thread.
<br>
If several clients are connected from the same address, these can not be distinguished.
<br>

All log messages are appended to the top of the textarea and the user can scroll through the list if there are more than can be displayed in a single window.
<br>
The server can be closed by the platform dependant window closing operation.
<br>
It is recommended to keep this window minimized during normal operation!
