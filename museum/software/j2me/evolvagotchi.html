<h2>Evolvagotchi</h2>
a never-ending multi-player game.<br>
<hr>
evolvagotchi is a game of evolving a game playing strategy that wins over a fixed other game playing strategy.
<br>
the strategies are played out on a virtual game which is done automatically by the game.
<br>
on installing the application, one random game playing stragety is created.
this is the own virtual player which plays the virtual game according to its own set of genes.
<br>
virtual players can be duplicated between phones through bluetooth.
once an oppenent-strategy has been downloaded from another phone, the game can begin.
<br>
evolving your own strategy against this oppentent is done by repeatedly automatically playing the game (according to the respective strategies of your own player and the oppenent) and recording the average win/lose outcome
<hr>
the process starts by creating a set of virtual players (population) which are similar to the own player but all have slight differences (genetical mutations) to its strategies.
<br>
all players play a number of games against the fixed opponent to determine their average win/lose outcome (fitness) according to their individual strategies vs the opponent.
<br>
evolution cycle starts by discarding the population member which has the lowest outcome.
<br>
the player with be best fitness will be duplicated and mutated (one of its genes slightly changed) again and added to the population.
<br>
then the fitness of the new population member will be determined again by playing a number of virtual games against the fixed opponent.
<br>
this process continues to eleminate "bad" strategies and propagate (and mutate) "good" strategies
<br>
after a while one member of the population should on average have more win outcomes when playing the virtual game against the downloaded opponent.
this strategy is then stored as the own player.
<br>
if the own virtual player is transferred to another phone, or another virtual player is downloaded to this phone, a different opponent (whose genes are different to the first oppenent) will have a different outcome against the own player and will need to evolve all over again.
<br>
several opponent strategies can be stored in the game
only the own player can be transferred to another phone
<hr>
the virtual game implementation which is currently undergoing experimentation is Tic Tac Toe.<br>
the virtual player's strategy is implemented as 3 genes:
<table><tr><td>
middle
</td></tr><tr><td>
corner
</td></tr><tr><td>
side
</td></tr></table>
each gene is an integer value with a minimum of 1.
all genes together have a value of 100.
<br>
a player determines its stragety for any move in any game setting simply by randomly selecting a value which activates a gene according to its size.
a player does not 'intelligently' try to prevent the opponent from taking a third square in a row, neither does it intentionally take a third sqaure if it has two in a row.
<br>
a player always performs a random move which is one of its genes. which gene performs is determined by its size and a random value.
<br>
for this game 3 distinct strategies can be evolved:
<table>
<tr><td>middle </td><td> corner </td></tr>
<tr><td>middle </td><td> side </td></tr>
<tr><td>side </td><td> corner </td></tr>
</table>
<hr>
<b>future version:</b>
<br>
the virtual game could be expanded to 5x5 Tic Tac Toe, offering 6 genes and several combination strategies <br>
symbol. gene (squares)
<table>
<tr><td>symbol</td><td>description</td><td>occurences</td></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>middle</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>side</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>corner</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>outer side</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>outer corner</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>outer cornerside</td><td>8</td></tr>
</table>

currently the mutation is implemented a-sexually.<br>
an ofspring is created by (duplicating the genes of the parent, then) decreasing the value of a gene (which has a value of more than 1) by 1 and increasing one of the other genes by one.<br>
the genetics of a player and mutation implementation could be expanded to an array of integers representing a string of genes and each gene representing a strategy by its value. [BBACAAFEACDDFE] the order is irrelevant.<br>
mutation could be performed by selecting two parents and randomly selecting genes from both parents to create the offspring (with or without mutation)
<br>
determining fitness of a member's stragety vs opponent is currently done by playing the same virtual game several times to determine the average win/lose outcome.<br>
this process could be expanded to include several different but similar games which will require a more general and versatile game playing stragety.
<br>
in general the best combination of variety and quality of genes is obtained by combining parents which are both highly succesfull vs the opponent but are most unequal to eachother.<br>
the task of selecting these parents could be performed by the user to increase the tamagotchi effect of the game.<br>
