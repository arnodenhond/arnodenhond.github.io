Although I’m not always as productive as I’d like to be, I do keep a lot of to-do lists on a multitude of topics. Writing stuff down helps me to fall asleep.

In the past I used [Google Tasks](https://tasks.google.com/tasks/) but I’m trying to reduce my use of Google products, so I’ve switched to [Gothenburg Bit Factory's TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/).

There were a variety of options but I have chosen this one for these reasons:

* It’s open source
    
* It’s offline-first
    
* It has a way to sync to your phone

As most of the other tools for TaskWarrior do not yet support version 3.0 I am still using 2.6.1 but I might upgrade in the future.

In the terminal I use [Dheepak Krishnamurthy's TUI](https://kdheepak.com/taskwarrior-tui/) to manage my tasks but I also use the [TaskWhisperer Gnome extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1039/taskwhisperer/).

Although it is possible to self-host your task server I have decided to start by using [Tim Case's WingTask](https://wingtask.com/) server which is free.

On my phone I use [CCExtractor’s TaskWarrior app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccextractor.taskwarriorflutter). Its not a very pretty app but it works.

TaskWarrior also has a companion app for time tracking called [TimeWarrior](https://timewarrior.net/) but I dont use that (yet)

So far I am quite pleased with TaskWarrior. Although I don’t use this feature yet, Task Warrior supports tags, which Google Tasks does not. I have also not yet started to use TaskWarrior’s Context feature but I plan to do so soon because I have quite a lot of Projects and I don’t always need to see all of them.

My self-imposed rules for TaskWarrior are:

* it’s not a museum. if a task has been untouched for a long time it has to go.
    
* all tasks must be actionable. so no wishes or dreams
    
* tasks must be atomic (projects are goals)
    
* once i start using tags I will use it so I can batch tasks by person, place or time.

Give it a try!
