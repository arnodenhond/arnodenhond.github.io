I first registered this domain on the 8th day of the 8th month of 2008 which is exactly 2⁴ years ago, more than a third of my life!

It was not the first domain I registered. I have also owned zodsoft.com and denhond.com but the former was free/ad supported and I let the latter lapse.

I registered arnodenhond.com through Google Domains and to this day I still have free use of Google Workspaces (legacy free edition). I can receive email on this domain but i rarely use it. I might hook the domain up to Proton Mail in the future.

Over the years the site has looked quite different even tough i used google sites most of the time. Here are some screenshots of my website over the years. (courtesy of archive.org)

The very first version hosted on Google Sites:

My Android website: (I also used to host downloadable graphics themes for one of my apps straight from this website)

Unfortunately Google Analytics doesn't show statistics from before 2015 but at one point this site actually got a modest amount of visitors every day. People mostly came to download my GraphView component. (which has since been stolen by someone else!)

I had Google Adsense banners on it but I never made much money with that.

A few years ago Google upgraded Sites and the conversion didn't work so I started using a Trello board as website:

Since 2 months I've been using Hashnode which is alright, so far.

I'm planning to post more articles to this blog in the future, so stay tuned!
