# About me

As a highly creative and experienced Android developer, I bring years of expertise in delivering fast and innovative solutions using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

Having successfully published apps on the Google Play Store and collaborated with large teams for big companies, I offer a deep understanding of Android development at all scales.

My unique problem-solving approach allows me to build apps quickly while crafting modern, engaging UI/UX designs.

I work closely with companies to reduce time to market and create standout mobile experiences that truly drive results.
